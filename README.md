# Spectral Analyzer

An audio waveform analyzer that provides user with real-time waveform amplitude and frequency data. Inspired by Graphic EQ systems.

Currently in early-development.

Implemented using React and Web APIs.

This app will allow users to upload audio files or use their computer's input (e.g. microphone, audio interface) to see real-time frequency data. I am currently developing additional functionality that will trace frequency data over time to provide user-configurable options for the visual representation of the audio to aid in performing EQ and compression mixing techniques on audio files.
